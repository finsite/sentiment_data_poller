  - [ ] SQS fallback support
  - [ ] Abstracted `QueueSender` with retries and logging

- [ ] **Vault Secret Integration**
  - Load API keys and credentials from Vault
  - Support fallback to environment variables

## üîÅ Data Handling Enhancements

- [ ] **Rate Limiting and Retry Logic**
  - Implement `RateLimiter` utility
  - Add exponential backoff with `retry_request`

- [ ] **Sentiment Scoring Models**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment

---

## üß™ Testing & CI/CD

- [ ] Add pytest unit tests for:
  - [ ] Each poller
  - [ ] Retry behavior
  - [ ] QueueSender integrations
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for:
  - [ ] Linting
  - [ ] Pytest
  - [ ] Pre-commit
